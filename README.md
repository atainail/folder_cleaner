This is a simple program I made. 
To start the program, go into your terminal in whatever IDE you are using and enter command "python index.py".
This program will open up your window explorer and allow you to pick a folder that has files that you want to move. 
It will allow you to create an new folder or an existing folder. 
Then you will choose which file type to move to the new or exising folder. 
All files with that type (ex. txt, py, etc) will be moved to new folder location.
At any point in time, type 'quit!' to end the program.
